If the learning rate is too low, the model may underfit the data as it updates its parameters very slowly. By increasing the learning rate, the model can learn faster and better fit the training data, thus reducing underfitting. Here is a simple code snippet demonstrating how learning rate tuning can be implemented:</p> <p>```python   model = create_model()  # Create your machine learning model   optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)  # Set initial learning rate   model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')  # Compile the model</p> <p># Train the model with adjusted learning rate   history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))   ```</p>"}]}
